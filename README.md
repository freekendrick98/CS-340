How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I always like to work with the mindset that everything is subject to change. Often I'll find a more efficent way to achieve my goals after I've designed or programed something. Making my code workable and easy to edit is what allows me to make changes like this. Comments telling me what each section does so I don't have to sift through code is very helpful as well. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach has remained the same throughout my time as a computer science major. I approach every problem and project with the hope to learn something new from it. Not all problems are the same and different problems require differnt approaches. This  poject was a series of articles and videos explaining what commands and specific keywords do to make my program work. When it comes the to client and their needs, I base the entire project around the needs of the client.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist can do a broad range of computer task from basic IT to programming and database management. A computer scientist is an all around knowledgable person when it comes to computers. Their type of work can help the productivity of a company in terms of the software and programming that goes into the advertising and marketing. They can also provide a smoother and faster user expierence for the customer and the employees.
